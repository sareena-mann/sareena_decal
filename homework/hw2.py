# 2) What does ~/ mean?
#       The home directory
# 3) What's the difference between and abolute and a relative path in your terminal?
#       An absolute path is exactly where, from start to end, a directory is located while a relative path is how to get to another directory from the directory you are currently on.
# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
#       cd

#       rm ./* would delete all files in current directory (not rm ./).
# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
#       Git add stages a change, git commit saves the changes to a local repo, and git push sends the changes to the remote repo.
# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
#       It would say files are ready to commit, but they haven't been commited yet. It is telling you to commit.
# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
#       As of now, none!
# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
#       Cloning creates a local copy of the fill while pulling updates the existing file.
